2,cd05,"The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the Back Bay -- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman , either in theology or in manners .",religion
3,cd05,"Ezra Stiles Gannett , an honorable representative of the sanhedrin , addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845 , insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist .",religion
4,cd05,"Even so , Gannett judiciously argued , the Association could legitimately decide that Parker `` should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness '' .",religion
5,cd05,We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations .,religion
6,cd05,"One can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church , and so to suppress it , rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it .",religion
7,cd05,"Finally , it did seem clear as day to these clergymen , as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father , they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of Christians .",religion
8,cd05,Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow `` free inquiry '' to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a `` natural '' religion .,religion
9,cd05,"Grant all this -- still , when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them , or else argue that after all Parker received the treatment he invited , they betray an uneasy conscience .",religion
10,cd05,"Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23 , 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association , while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating , `` The difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ; ;",religion
11,cd05,"the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity '' -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances , the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief , of positive thanksgiving , that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker .",religion
12,cd05,"Had it done so , the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible , nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying `` peccavi '' .",religion
13,cd05,"Happily for posterity , then , the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room , though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality .",religion
14,cd05,"Fortunately , the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity , as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins ; ;",religion
15,cd05,"whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room , though not out of the Fellowship .",religion
16,cd05,"In the hall , after adjournment , Dr. Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears .",religion
17,cd05,"All this near tragedy , which to us borders on comedy , enables us to tell the story over and over again , always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency .",religion
18,cd05,"It was indeed a near thing , but somehow the inherent decency of New England ( which we inherit ) did triumph .",religion
19,cd05,Parker was never excommunicated .,religion
20,cd05,"To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled , we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it .",religion
21,cd05,"Yet , even after all these stratagems , the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest , any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him .",religion
22,cd05,"In both cases the stubborn fact remains : liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates , both legitimate offspring of its loins , and when brought to the test , it behaved shabbily .",religion
23,cd05,Suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel : is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion ? ?,religion
24,cd05,Is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about ? ?,religion
25,cd05,"However , there is a crucial difference between the two histories .",religion
26,cd05,"Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside , or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the Unitarian communion , so that it could lick the wound of his departure , preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration .",religion
27,cd05,"Parker insisted upon not resigning , even when the majority wanted him to depart , upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out .",religion
28,cd05,"Hence he was in his lifetime , as is the memory of him afterwards , a canker within the liberal sensitivity .",religion
29,cd05,"He still points an accusing finger at all of us , telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat .",religion
30,cd05,"Actually , the dispute between Parker and the society of his time , both ecclesiastical and social , was a real one , a bitter one .",religion
31,cd05,It cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him .,religion
32,cd05,"The fact is incontestable : that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow-minded , intellectually sterile , smug , afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm , and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened .",religion
33,cd05,"Parker , along with Garrison and Charles Sumner , showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery .",religion
34,cd05,"Nevertheless , we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; ;",religion
35,cd05,"their passions were genuine , and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut .",religion
36,cd05,"But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem , which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom .",religion
37,cd05,"Even though his theological theses have become , to us , commonplaces , the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us .",religion
38,cd05,"It has been endlessly rephrased , but I may here put it thus : at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant ? ?",religion
39,cd05,"And then , as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience , what do they , to their dismay , learn for the first time about themselves ? ?",religion
40,cd05,"There can be no doubt , the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior .",religion
41,cd05,"The gentle Channing , revered by all Bostonians , orthodox or Unitarian , wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit , that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action : `` No city in the world is governed so little by a police , and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment .",religion
42,cd05,We stand more in awe of one another than most people .,religion
43,cd05,"Opinion is less individual or runs more into masses , and often rules with a rod of iron '' .",religion
44,cd05,"Even more poignantly , and with the insight of a genius , Channing added -- remember , this is Channing , not Parker ! !",religion
45,cd05,"-- that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart , should he `` speak without book , and consequently break some law of speech , or be hurried into some daring hyperbole , he should find little mercy '' .",religion
46,cd05,Channing wrote this -- in a letter ! !,religion
47,cd05,I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons .,religion
48,cd05,"But Theodore Parker , commencing his mission to the world-at-large , disguised as the minister of a `` twenty-eighth Congregational Church '' which bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the Unitarian churches ) , made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum .",religion
49,cd05,Because he spoke openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- Parker vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines .,religion
50,cd05,"An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution , and only within those defined limits a license .",religion
51,cd05,"By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation , we should , I am sure , come to a fresh realization , however painful it be , that the battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest .",religion
52,cd05,"He arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with , at the least , resentment .",religion
53,cd05,"What otherwise could `` the lawyer , doctor , minister , the men of science and letters '' do when told that they had `` become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant , and continually cried , ' Holy , holy , holy is the Almighty Dollar ' `` ? ?",religion
54,cd05,"Nor , when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration , should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them thus : `` Talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells ! !",religion
55,cd05,Reproach the Catholics for it ! !,religion
56,cd05,You and I do the same thing .,religion
57,cd05,"There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom , nor a mitre on their head , who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome , but to the Almighty Dollar , a pope much nearer home .",religion
58,cd05,"Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists , lawyers and other managers , who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think '' .",religion
59,cd05,This was war .,religion
60,cd05,Parker meant business .,religion
61,cd05,"And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them : `` Even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria , and are worse than those who deceived them '' -- which implied that they were very bad indeed .",religion
62,cd05,"It was `` Duty '' he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform , though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty .",religion
63,cd05,Parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents .,religion
64,cd05,"`` If it gave me pleasure to say hard things '' , he wrote , `` I would shut up forever '' .",religion
65,cd05,"We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in this vein , he believed what he said , because he could continue , `` But the truth , which cost me bitter tears to say , I must speak , though it cost other tears hotter than fire '' .",religion
66,cd05,"Because he copiously shed his own tears , and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England , he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's consciences .",religion
67,cd05,"Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its Christian survival , that of the literal , factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels .",religion
68,cd05,"It is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody , professing the deepest piety , decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A.M. on the third of August , A.D. 32 .",religion
69,cd05,We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed .,religion

72,cf37,The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies .,lore
73,cf37,But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life .,lore
74,cf37,"The Christian education of children , too , was once hardly more than a sideshow , but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty .",lore
75,cf37,The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives .,lore
76,cf37,"Most pastors and laymen , even though they believe it to be important , assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes .",lore
77,cf37,"They may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the `` ecclesiastical Rover Boys '' , as someone has dubbed them , who like to go to national and international assemblies , and have expense accounts that permit them to do so .",lore
78,cf37,"As long as this point of view prevails , the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt .",lore
79,cf37,The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community .,lore
80,cf37,"Progress will take place far less through what is done in any `` summit conference '' of the National Council or the World Council , or even in offices of the denominational boards , than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors .",lore
81,cf37,The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side .,lore
82,cf37,"Until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes , programs , and relationships , it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality .",lore
83,cf37,"As things now stand , there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation .",lore
84,cf37,The ecumenical congregation,lore
85,cf37,The crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community .,lore

87,cf37,It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet .,lore
88,cf37,It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical .,lore
89,cf37,It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be `` carried down to the grass roots '' .,lore
90,cf37,This way of describing the matter is unfortunate .,lore
91,cf37,It implies two misconceptions .,lore
92,cf37,One is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at `` the top '' and needs only to be understood at the so-called `` lower levels '' .,lore
93,cf37,"The truth , however , is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world .",lore
94,cf37,"The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections , now comprehended by many national leaders , can be communicated to all congregations .",lore
95,cf37,"However needed this may be , the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world .",lore
96,cf37,"The basic unit in the church , of whatever denominational polity , is always the congregation .",lore
97,cf37,It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much .,lore
98,cf37,"Most people do not realize that the congregation , as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face , personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another , is unique .",lore
99,cf37,The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken .,lore
100,cf37,"The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation , but Hinduism , Buddhism , Islam , Confucianism , Taoism , Shintoism , although they have sacred scriptures , priests , spiritual disciplines , and places of prayer , do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love .",lore
101,cf37,Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship .,lore
102,cf37,How far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia ! !,lore
103,cf37,What is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes .,lore
104,cf37,The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ .,lore
105,cf37,It is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of Christ in His people .,lore
106,cf37,"As Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it , `` Our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us '' .",lore
107,cf37,"This may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom , on the level of merely human agreeableness , we might prefer not to have any association at all .",lore
108,cf37,There is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building .,lore
109,cf37,"Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church , in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world , a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid .",lore
110,cf37,The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists .,lore
111,cf37,The local and the ecumenical are one .,lore
112,cf37,"Of course , the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the People of God will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place .",lore
113,cf37,Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other .,lore
114,cf37,Neither is adequate if it stands alone .,lore
115,cf37,Our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other .,lore
116,cf37,And this is what all too often happens .,lore
117,cf37,Divergent perspectives,lore
118,cf37,A little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War .,lore
119,cf37,With great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches .,lore
120,cf37,"When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles , his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones .",lore
121,cf37,They were bifocals .,lore
122,cf37,He often spoke of them as his `` ecumenical '' glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church .,lore
123,cf37,"It is , he said , a bifocal vision , which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both .",lore
124,cf37,"As things stand now , the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other .",lore
125,cf37,"On the one hand , there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town .",lore
126,cf37,They do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling .,lore
127,cf37,Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-Gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy ! !,lore
128,cf37,"Likewise , the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany , the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China , and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship , pastoral service and counseling , and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals .",lore
129,cf37,"On the other hand , many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate , personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission .",lore
130,cf37,"As a result , they go on thinking of the church , with introverted and self-centered satisfaction , only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families .",lore
131,cf37,It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members .,lore
132,cf37,The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world .,lore
133,cf37,The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs .,lore
134,cf37,It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards .,lore
135,cf37,It is growing in numbers .,lore
136,cf37,Its people are agreeable friends .,lore
137,cf37,It has a beautiful edifice .,lore
138,cf37,Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain .,lore
139,cf37,It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled .,lore
140,cf37,It helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible .,lore
141,cf37,It draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation .,lore
142,cf37,And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is .,lore
143,cf37,But what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians in the world ? ?,lore
144,cf37,All too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind .,lore
145,cf37,It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ .,lore
146,cf37,It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy .,lore
147,cf37,It is not making them sensitive to the sub-Christian level of much of our economic and industrial life .,lore
148,cf37,It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples .,lore
149,cf37,It is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa .,lore
150,cf37,"To put it bluntly , many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want .",lore
151,cf37,It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world .,lore
152,cf37,We shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world .,lore
153,cf37,There is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community .,lore
154,cf37,"He built a school and a library , then a recreation center and an inn .",lore
155,cf37,"Desiring to fill the only remaining lack , he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it .",lore

157,cf37,"`` Why , no , ma'am '' , he replied , `` this church belongs to me '' ! !",lore
158,cf37,The story reflects the way too many people feel .,lore
159,cf37,"As long as the congregation regards the church as `` our '' church , or the minister thinks of it as `` my '' church , just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance .",lore
160,cf37,"There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ , and that it is His purpose , not our own interests and preferences , that determines what it is to be and do .",lore
161,cf37,Local embodiment of the whole,lore
162,cf37,"A local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra , not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church .",lore
163,cf37,It would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ .,lore
164,cf37,"Yet the truth , according to the New Testament , is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place .",lore
165,cj50,"Unfortunately , however , and for reasons to be discussed in the following chapter , no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal costs in order to yield adequate revenues .",learned
166,cj50,And this fact may explain some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units of service .,learned
167,cj50,"One such disagreement , which will receive attention in this next chapter , concerns the question whether rates for different kinds of service , in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination , must be made directly proportional to marginal costs , or whether they should be based instead on differences in marginal costs .",learned
168,cj50,"Here , the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma .",learned
169,cj50,Two major types of fully distributed cost analysis,learned
170,cj50,1 .,learned
171,cj50,The double-step type,learned
172,cj50,"Despite an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define `` relative costs '' , the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice .",learned
173,cj50,"For more explicit expositions , one must distinguish different types of analyses .",learned
174,cj50,"By all means the most important distinction is that between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental or marginal costs , and those other apportionments which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution .",learned
175,cj50,"The first , or double-step , type might also be called the `` railroad type '' because of its application to railroads ( and other transportation agencies ) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce Commission .",learned
176,cj50,The Cost Section distinguishes between ( directly ) variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding chapter .,learned
177,cj50,The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units of freight traffic as representing `` long-run out-of-pocket costs '' -- a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of the economist's `` long-run marginal costs '' .,learned
178,cj50,"There remains a residue of total costs , or total `` revenue requirements '' which , since it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations in traffic density , is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis .",learned
179,cj50,"Nevertheless , because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make some kind of a distribution of total costs , it has apportioned this residue , which it sometimes calls `` burden '' , among the units of carload traffic on a basis ( partly ton , partly ton-mile ) which is concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination .",learned
180,cj50,"In recent years , this burden ( which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic ! !",learned
181,cj50,) has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to meet .,learned
182,cj50,"Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad rates , it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket costs and apportioned residue costs .",learned
183,cj50,Suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment is questionable .,learned
184,cj50,"But in any event , full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost analyses : namely , that between a cost allocation designed to reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates of output of different classes of utility service ; ;",learned
185,cj50,and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination .,learned
186,cj50,2 .,learned
187,cj50,The single-step type,learned
188,cj50,"We turn now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which , unlike the `` railroad type '' , draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment : the single-step type .",learned
189,cj50,It might be called the `` public utility '' type because of the considerable use to which it has been put in gas and electric utility rate cases .,learned
190,cj50,"Here no attempt is made , first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose on these costs `` reasonably distributed '' residues of total costs .",learned
191,cj50,"Instead , all of the total costs are treated as variable costs , although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be functions of different variables .",learned
192,cj50,"Moreover , whereas in Interstate Commerce Commission parlance `` variable cost '' means a cost deemed to vary in direct proportion to changes in rate of output , in the type of analysis now under review `` variable cost '' has been used more broadly , so as to cover costs which , while a function of some one variable ( such as output of energy , or number of customers ) , are not necessarily a linear function .",learned
193,cj50,"As already noted in an earlier paragraph , the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes of service , such as residential , commercial , industrial power , street lighting , etc. .",learned
194,cj50,"This `` grand division '' permits many costs to be assigned in their entirety to some one class , such as street lighting , or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes .",learned
195,cj50,"High-tension industrial power service , for example , would not be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of the low-tension distribution lines .",learned
196,cj50,"But the major portions of the total costs of a utility business are common or joint to all , or nearly all , classes of customers ; ;",learned
197,cj50,and these costs must somehow be apportioned among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among the units of service in order to report unit costs that can serve as tentative measures of reasonable rates .,learned
198,cj50,The general basis on which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem of an electric-utility cost analysis .,learned
199,cj50,"But before turning to this example , we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis , both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type .",learned
200,cj50,"In the first subtype , the analyst ( following the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect ) distributes both total operating costs and total annual capital costs ( including an allowance for `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' ) among the different classes and units of service .",learned
201,cj50,"Here , an apportionment , say , of $5,000,000 of the total costs to residential service as a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers .",learned
202,cj50,"But in the second subtype , which I take to be the one more frequently applied , only the operating expenses and not the `` cost of capital '' or `` fair return '' are apportioned directly among the various classes of service .",learned
203,cj50,"To be sure , the capital investments in ( or , alternatively , the estimated `` fair values '' of ) the plant and equipment are apportioned among the different classes , as are also the gross revenues received from the sales of the different services .",learned
204,cj50,But any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a `` return '' realized on the capital investment attributed to the same service .,learned
205,cj50,"Thus , during any given year ( A ) if the revenues from the residential service are $7,000,000 , ( B ) if the operating expenses imputed to this class of service come to $5,000,000 , and ( C ) if the net investment in ( or value of ) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this service amounts to $30,000,000 , the cost analyst will report that residential service , in the aggregate , has yielded a return of $2,000,000 or 6-2 per cent .",learned
206,cj50,"Other services will show different rates of return , some probably much lower and some higher .",learned
207,cj50,"There are obvious reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding `` cost of capital '' from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different classes of service -- notably , the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be held to constitute `` cost of capital '' or `` fair rate of return '' .",learned
208,cj50,"But the practice is likely to be misleading , since it may seem to support a conclusion that , as long as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating expenses plus some return on capital investment , however low , the rates of charge for this service are compensatory .",learned
209,cj50,"Needless to say , any such inference would be quite unwarranted .",learned
210,cj50,"For the reason just suggested , I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed cost apportionment in the following simplified example .",learned
211,cj50,"That is to say , an allowance for `` cost of capital '' will be assumed to be included directly in the cost apportionment .",learned
212,cj50,Three-part analysis of the costs of an electric utility business,learned
213,cj50,"In order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis , let us assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supplying a single city with power generated by its own steam-generation plant .",learned
214,cj50,"Let us also assume the existence of only one class or type of service , all of which is supplied at the same voltage , phase , etc. to residential , commercial , and industrial customers .",learned
215,cj50,This latter assumption will permit us to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis -- the distinction among costs that are functions of outputs of the same service measured along different dimensions .,learned
216,cj50,"Since the company under review is supplying what we are here regarding as only one kind of service , we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple ; ;",learned
217,cj50,"indeed , that it would be limited to a finding of the total annual operating and capital costs of the business , followed by a calculation of this total in terms of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption .",learned
218,cj50,"In fact , however , the problem is not so simple .",learned
219,cj50,For a statement of costs per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these costs are not a function of kilowatt-hour output ( or consumption ) of energy .,learned
220,cj50,A recognition of multiple cost functions is therefore required .,learned
221,cj50,"The simplest division , and the one most frequently used ( with subdivisions ) in gas and electric rate cases , is a threefold division of the total operating and capital costs into `` customer costs '' , `` energy '' or `` volumetric costs '' , and `` demand '' or `` capacity '' costs .",learned
222,cj50,"If this threefold division of costs were to have its counterpart in the actual rates of charge for service , as it actually does have in some rates , there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service .",learned
223,cj50,"For example , the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $1 customer charge , a $5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hours of energy at",learned
224,cj50,"per kilowatt-hour , and a $2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatts during the month at the rate of $1 per kilowatt -- a total bill of $8 for that month .",learned
225,cj50,"But our present interest lies in the measurement of costs of service , and only indirectly in rates that may or may not be designed to cover these costs .",learned
226,cj50,"Let us therefore consider each of the three types of cost in turn , recognizing that this simplified classification is used only for illustrative purposes ; ;",learned
227,cj50,costs actually vary in much more complex ways .,learned
228,cj50,1 .,learned
229,cj50,The customer costs,learned
230,cj50,"These are those operating and capital costs found to vary with number of customers regardless , or almost regardless , of power consumption .",learned
231,cj50,Included as a minimum are the costs of metering and billing along with whatever other expenses the company must incur in taking on another consumer .,learned
232,cj50,"These minimum costs may come to $1 per month , more or less , for residential and small commercial customers , although they are substantially higher for large industrial users , who require more costly connections and metering devices .",learned
233,cj50,"While costs on this order are sometimes separately charged for in residential and commercial rates , in the form of a mere `` service charge '' , they are more frequently wholly or partly covered by a minimum charge which entitles the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no further payment .",learned
234,cj50,"But the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arises because of the cost analyst's frequent practice of including , not just those costs that can be definitely earmarked as incurred for the benefit of specific customers but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital costs of the secondary ( low-voltage ) distribution system -- a fraction equal to the estimated annual costs of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity .",learned

261,cf08,"It can , in fact , wreck a marriage .",lore
262,cf08,"When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires , she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her .",lore
263,cf08,"And she begins to regard him as savage , bestial and unworthy .",lore

274,cf08,This woman repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations .,lore
275,cf08,"To please her , her husband assumed some of the domestic chores .",lore
276,cf08,"Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes , bathing the children , and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them .",lore
277,cf08,"One wife , described by a New York psychologist , so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule , writing it down right between the weekly PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties .",lore

283,cf08,"The husband is usually a well-educated professional , preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : `` Don't rock the boat '' .",lore
284,cf08,Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage .,lore
285,cf08,"Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area .",lore
286,cf08,"More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home .",lore
287,cf08,"Some psychologists , in fact , suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives .",lore
288,cf08,"The wife's attempt at control , these psychologists contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job .",lore
289,cf08,Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative .,lore
290,cf08,"Unless her husband also desires sex , the act cannot be consummated .",lore
291,cf08,"Generally , however , in such marriages as those cited , the husband is at his wife's mercy .",lore
292,cf08,"`` The pattern '' , says Dr. Morton Schillinger , psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy , `` is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night '' .",lore
293,cf08,"No one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife is , sexually speaking , a new character in our world .",lore

295,cf08,There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom .,lore

303,cf08,Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept .,lore
304,cf08,"Family survival on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ; ;",lore
305,cf08,"and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything , including the marriage bed .",lore
306,cf08,"This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries , when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner .",lore

310,cf08,When was the turning point ? ?,lore

312,cf08,"Some date it from woman suffrage , others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace , still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin .",lore
313,cf08,"Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs .",lore
314,cf08,"Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city , the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male .",lore
315,cf08,"Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing , money-handling and home maintenance .",lore
316,cf08,She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless .,lore
317,cf08,"She liked this taste of authority and independence , and , with darkness , was not likely to give it up .",lore
318,cf08,"`` Very few wives '' , says Dr. Calderone , `` who balance the checkbook , fix the car , choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned .",lore
319,cf08,A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well '' .,lore
320,cf08,And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response .,lore
321,cf08,Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax .,lore
322,cf08,They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response .,lore
323,cf08,"In fact , the noted psychologist and sex researcher , Dr. Albert Ellis , has declared flatly that women are `` sexually superior '' to men .",lore
324,cf08,"According to Dr. Ellis , the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner .",lore
325,cf08,"Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis says , some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities .",lore
326,cf08,"Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden , many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them .",lore
327,cf08,"An aggressive woman wants a man to demand , not knuckle under .",lore
328,cf08,"`` When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness '' , Dr. Linden says , `` the wife , in turn , finds him inadequate .",lore
329,cf08,Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction '' .,lore
330,cf08,"One such wife , Dr. Linden says , became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man .",lore
331,cf08,"But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity .",lore
332,cf08,Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list .,lore
333,cf08,"In some cases , however , domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need .",lore
334,cf08,Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion .,lore
335,cf08,"If his on-the-job problems work out , he may return to his old pattern .",lore
336,cf08,Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up .,lore
337,cf08,"On the other hand , a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking , psychologists say , for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable .",lore
338,cf08,"Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego lifted .",lore
339,cf08,"In any case , Dr. Calderone remarks , such problems are a couple's own affair , and can't always be measured by a general yardstick .",lore
340,cf08,"`` As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex , it makes little difference if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone declares .",lore
341,cf08,`` The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment '' .,lore
342,cf08,"Other experts say , however , that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period , it is likely to shake the marriage .",lore
343,cf08,"And just as domination today often begins with the wife , so the cure generally must lie with the husband .",lore
344,cf08,"`` To get a marriage back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute , `` the husband must take some very basic steps .",lore
345,cf08,"He must begin , paradoxically , by becoming more selfish .",lore
346,cf08,"He must become more expressive of his own desires , more demanding and less ' understanding ' '' .",lore

422,cl06,"One thing , he thought , nobody knows about it yet .",mystery
423,cl06,Only me .,mystery
424,cl06,"He climbed the stairs , went into Roberts' room , found a suitcase and packed as much into it as he could .",mystery
425,cl06,He left a few things .,mystery
426,cl06,It didn't have to be perfect .,mystery
427,cl06,Roberts was a wastrel .,mystery

430,cl06,It took him nearly an hour .,mystery
431,cl06,He went to the room he had rented and got into his overcoat .,mystery
432,cl06,He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby .,mystery
433,cl06,"He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door , went outside and walked back to the garage .",mystery
434,cl06,He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing .,mystery
435,cl06,"It snowed softly , silently , an undulating interruption of his vision against the night sky .",mystery
436,cl06,He could feel it on his face and in his hair .,mystery
437,cl06,"He found the key to the Jeep , got it started and warmed it up for five minutes .",mystery
438,cl06,Then he backed out and swung around to the front drive .,mystery
439,cl06,He went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor .,mystery
440,cl06,He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping .,mystery
441,cl06,He took the suitcase out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat .,mystery
442,cl06,Then he went back for Roberts .,mystery
443,cl06,The body was heavier than he had anticipated .,mystery
444,cl06,He got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down to the Jeep .,mystery
445,cl06,"He dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't roll out , then returned to the porch and closed the front door , making sure it was unlocked .",mystery
446,cl06,He drove carefully in the direction of the brief tour they had taken earlier .,mystery
447,cl06,"It snowed continuously , but quietly , evenly .",mystery
448,cl06,"When he reached the dip in the woods , he saw that already the earlier ruts were barely discernible .",mystery
449,cl06,The Jeep fought its way through the low spot and got onto higher ground .,mystery
450,cl06,He drove in low gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance to the abandoned mine .,mystery
451,cl06,"He parked facing it and left the headlights on , but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase , he found the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the passage .",mystery
452,cl06,"He went back and got the flashlight , returned to the tunnel and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier .",mystery
453,cl06,He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around it .,mystery
454,cl06,"When the dust settled , he went back to the Jeep and carefully worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder .",mystery
455,cl06,It wasn't like carrying the suitcase .,mystery
456,cl06,The soft snow was deceitful underfoot .,mystery
457,cl06,Twice he nearly fell .,mystery

459,cl06,By the time he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back ached under the drag of the dead weight .,mystery
460,cl06,"He stood looking down for a few seconds , then backed up two or three paces from the edge .",mystery
461,cl06,There was too much weight casually to toss it away .,mystery
462,cl06,He could feel himself falling in with it and being unable to get out .,mystery
463,cl06,It would be a bad place to die .,mystery
464,cl06,"It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up , but Roberts had asked for it .",mystery
465,cl06,It was too late to worry about that .,mystery
466,cl06,He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel .,mystery
467,cl06,It was a relief to get rid of the weight .,mystery
468,cl06,He was shaking with tension and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down .,mystery
469,cl06,Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge .,mystery
470,cl06,It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off .,mystery
471,cl06,"He gave it a strong push , heard it slide , then tumble dryly into the hole .",mystery
472,cl06,He got to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit .,mystery
473,cl06,The body lay in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel floor .,mystery
474,cl06,"Deep enough , he decided .",mystery
475,cl06,There was little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter .,mystery
476,cl06,"The external signs of his approach to it would be covered by the snow , probably by the next day .",mystery
477,cl06,It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact .,mystery
478,cl06,By spring it would be a skeleton .,mystery
479,cl06,He made his way back to the Jeep .,mystery
480,cl06,He had started to back into the turn when he remembered the razor in his pocket .,mystery
481,cl06,"He climbed down , went back into the tunnel and tossed the razor into the pit .",mystery
482,cl06,"It landed on Roberts' sprawled right thigh , poised precariously , then slid off to the ground .",mystery
483,cl06,He went back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel .,mystery
484,cl06,In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had made of it .,mystery
485,cl06,"There were stains here and there and he cleaned them off , using an oiled rag he found on a nail .",mystery
486,cl06,He wiped the steering wheel and all the places he might have touched the Jeep .,mystery
487,cl06,"He replaced the flashlight where it had been stowed , got into his own car and backed it out of the garage .",mystery
488,cl06,"There were tire marks where it had been , but they were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny .",mystery
489,cl06,"Liz Peabody , he thought , might spend some time grieving for her lost lover , but he doubted that she would launch an investigation .",mystery
490,cl06,"He judged her to be a woman of some pride , though not much sense .",mystery
491,cl06,"Still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who , apparently , had run away .",mystery
492,cj68,"Recent criticism of Great Expectations has tended to emphasize its symbolic and mythic content , to show , as M. D. Zabel has said of Dickens generally , that much of the novel's impact resides in its `` allegoric insight and moral metaphor '' .",learned
493,cj68,J. H. Miller's excellent chapter on Great Expectations has lately illustrated how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective .,learned
494,cj68,"In his analysis , however , he touches upon but fails to explore an idea , generally neglected in discussions of the book , which I believe is central to its art -- the importance of human hands as a recurring feature of the narrative .",learned
495,cj68,This essay seeks to make that exploration .,learned
496,cj68,Dickens was not for nothing the most theatrical of the great Victorian writers .,learned
497,cj68,"He knew instinctively that next to voice and face an actor's hands are his most useful possession -- that in fiction as in the theatre , gesture is an indispensable shorthand for individualizing character and dramatizing action and response .",learned
498,cj68,"It is hardly accidental , therefore , that many of his most vivid figures do suggestive or eccentric things with their hands .",learned
499,cj68,In Great Expectations the hands become almost an obsession .,learned
500,cj68,"Mr. Jaggers habitually bites his forefinger , a gesture which conveys both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinates , half terrifies all who have dealings with him .",learned
501,cj68,"Miss Havisham's withered hands , heavy as if her unhappiness were somehow concentrated in them , move in restless self-pity between her broken heart and her walking stick .",learned
502,cj68,Pumblechook's `` signature '' is the perpetually extended glad hand .,learned
503,cj68,Wemmick reveals his self-satisfaction by regularly rubbing his hands together .,learned
504,cj68,"Old Mr. Pocket's frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless , social-climbing wife is to `` put his two hands into his disturbed hair '' and `` make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it '' , whereas Joe Gargery endures the shrewish onslaughts of Mrs. Joe by apologetically drawing `` the back of his hand across and across his nose '' .",learned
505,cj68,"Such mannerisms would be less worthy of remark , were it not that in Great Expectations , as in no other of Dickens' novels , hands serve as a leitmotif of plot and theme -- a kind of unifying symbol or natural metaphor for the book's complex of human interrelationships and the values and attitudes that motivate them .",learned
506,cj68,"Dickens not only reveals character through gesture , he makes hands a crucial element of the plot , a means of clarifying the structure of the novel by helping to define the hero's relations with all the major characters , and a device for ordering such diverse themes as guilt , pursuit , crime , greed , education , materialism , enslavement ( by both people and institutions ) , friendship , romantic love , forgiveness , and redemption .",learned
507,cj68,"We have only to think of Lady Macbeth or the policeman-murderer in Thomas Burke's famous story , `` The Hands Of Mr. Ottermole '' , to realize that hands often call up ideas of crime and punishment .",learned
508,cj68,"So it is with Great Expectations , whether the hands be Orlick's as he strikes down Mrs. Gargery or Pip's as he steals a pie from her pantry .",learned
509,cj68,"Such associations suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspects of Dickens' novel , but , on a deeper plane , they relate to the themes of sin , guilt , and pursuit that have recently been analyzed by other critics .",learned
510,cj68,"The novel opens with a fugitive convict frantically trying to avoid the nemesis of being `` laid hands on '' -- a mysterious figure who looks into Pip's frightened eyes in the churchyard `` as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people , stretching up cautiously out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in '' .",learned
511,cj68,"Magwitch terrifies Pip into stealing a pork pie for him by creating the image in the boy's imagination of a bogy man who may `` softly creep his way to him and tear him open '' , `` imbruing his hands '' in him .",learned
512,cj68,"As Pip agonizes over the theft that his own hands have committed , his guilty conscience projects itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost , transforming it into `` a phantom devoting me to the Hulks '' .",learned
513,cj68,"Held upside down in the graveyard , Pip clings in terror `` with both hands '' to his convict ; ;",learned
514,cj68,later he flees in panic from the family table just as his theft is about to be discovered and is blocked at the front door by a soldier who accusingly holds out a pair of handcuffs which he has brought to Gargery's forge for mending .,learned
515,cj68,Through such details Dickens indicates at the outset that guilt is a part of the ironic bond between Pip and Magwitch which is so unpredictably to alter both their lives .,learned
516,cj68,"Since they commonly translate thoughts and feelings into deeds , hands naturally represent action , and since nearly half the characters in Great Expectations are of the underworld or closely allied to it , the linking of hands with crime or violence is not to be wondered at .",learned
517,cj68,"Dickens , for excellent psychological reasons , never fully reveals Magwitch's felonious past , but Pip , at the convict's climactic reappearance in London , shrinks from clasping a hand which he fears `` might be stained with blood '' .",learned
518,cj68,"Orlick slouches about the forge `` like Cain '' with `` his hands in his pockets '' , and when he shouts abuse at Mrs. Joe for objecting to his holiday , she claps her hands in a tantrum , beats them `` upon her bosom and upon her knees '' , and clenches them in her husband's hair .",learned
519,cj68,"This last `` rampage '' is only the prelude to the vicious blow upon her head , `` dealt by some unknown hand '' whose identity is later revealed not verbally but through a manual action -- the tracing of Orlick's hammer upon a slate .",learned
520,cj68,Pip himself is to feel the terror of Orlick's `` murderous hand '' in his secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marshes .,learned
521,cj68,Dickens lays great emphasis on the hands in this scene .,learned
522,cj68,"Orlick shakes his hand at Pip , bangs the table with his fist , draws his unclenched hand `` across his mouth as if his mouth watered '' for his victim , lets his hands hang `` loose and heavy at his sides '' , and Pip observes him so intensely that he knows `` of the slightest action of his fingers '' .",learned
523,cj68,"Orlick might almost be Magwitch's bogy man come alive , a figure of nemesis from Pip's phantasy of guilt .",learned
524,cj68,"The scarred , disfigured wrists of Mr. Jaggers' housekeeper are the tell-tale marks of her sinister past , for her master , coolly exhibiting them to his dinner guests , makes a point of the `` force of grip there is in these hands '' .",learned
525,cj68,"Jaggers' iron control over her ( `` she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , hesitatingly , as if she dreaded his calling her back ) '' ) rests on his having once got her acquitted of a murder charge by cleverly contriving her sleeves at the trial to conceal her strength and by passing off the lacerations on the backs of her hands as the scratches of brambles rather than of human fingernails .",learned
526,cj68,It is the similarity between Estella's hands and Molly's ( `` The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting '' ) that provides Pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establishes a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of Satis House .,learned
527,cj68,"Finally , Magwitch's pursuit of Compeyson , his archenemy and betrayer , begins by his holding him in a vicelike grip on the river flats to frustrate his escape and culminates in his `` laying his hand on his cloak to identify him '' , thus precipitating the death-locked struggle in the water during which Compeyson drowns .",learned
528,cj68,Magwitch's hand here ironically becomes the agent of justice .,learned
529,cj68,"But only in one of its aspects is Great Expectations a tale of violence , revenge , and retribution .",learned
530,cj68,"Money , so important a theme elsewhere in Dickens , is here central , and hands are often associated in some way with the false values -- acquisitiveness , snobbery , self-interest , hypocrisy , toadyism , irresponsibility , injustice -- that attach to a society based upon the pursuit of wealth .",learned
531,cj68,"Dickens suggests the economic evils of such a society on the first page of his novel in the description of Pip's five little dead brothers `` who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle '' , who seemed to have `` all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets , and had never taken them out in this state of existence '' .",learned
532,cj68,"Pip's great expectations , his progress through illusion and disillusionment , turn , somewhat as they do for the naive hero of Dreiser's American Tragedy , upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income -- what Wemmick calls `` portable property '' and what Jaggers reproaches Pip for letting `` slip through ( his ) fingers '' .",learned
533,cj68,"Since a gentleman must , if possible , avoid sullying them by work , his hands , as importantly as his accent , become the index of social status .",learned
534,cj68,"Almost the first step in the corruption of Pip's values is the unworthy shame he feels when Estella cruelly remarks the coarseness of his hands : `` They had never troubled me before , but they troubled me now , as vulgar appendages '' .",learned
535,cj68,"Pip imagines how Estella would look down upon Joe's hands , roughened by work in the smithy , and the deliberate contrast between her white hands and his blackened ones is made to symbolize the opposition of values between which Pip struggles -- idleness and work , artificiality and naturalness , gentility and commonness , coldness and affection -- in fact , between Satis House and the forge .",learned
536,cj68,"When the snobbery that alienates Pip from Joe finally gives way before the deeper and stronger force of love , the reunion is marked by an embarrassed handshake at which Pip exclaims : `` No , don't wipe it off -- for God's sake , give me your blackened hand '' ! !",learned
537,cj68,"Pip's abject leave-taking of Miss Havisham , during which he kneels to kiss her hand , signalizes his homage to a supposed patroness who seems to be opening up for him a new world of glamour ; ;",learned
538,cj68,"when , on the journey to London that immediately follows , he pauses nostalgically to lay his hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village , the wooden pointer symbolically designates a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity .",learned
539,cj68,"Incidentally , one cannot miss the significance of this gesture , for Dickens reintroduces it associatively in Pip's mind at another moral and psychological crisis -- his painful recognition , in a talk with Herbert Pocket , that his hopeless attachment to Estella is as self-destructive as it is romantic .",learned
540,cj68,In both cases the finger-post represents Pip's heightened awareness of contrary magnetisms .,learned
541,cj68,A variety of hand movements helps dramatize the moral climate of the fallen world Pip encounters beyond the forge .,learned
542,cj68,"The vulture-like attendance of the Pocket family upon Miss Havisham is summed up in the hypocritical gestures of Miss Camilla Pocket , who puts her hand to her throat in a feigned spasm of grief-stricken choking , then lays it `` upon her heaving bosom '' with `` an unnatural fortitude of manner '' , and finally kisses it to Miss Havisham in a parody of the lady's own mannerism toward Estella .",learned
543,cj68,Pumblechook's hands throughout the novel serve to travesty greed and hypocritical self-aggrandizement .,learned
544,cj68,We first see him shaking Mrs. Joe's hand on discovering the sizable amount of the premium paid to her husband for Pip's indenture as an apprentice and later pumping Pip's hands `` for the hundredth time at least '' ( `` May I -- may I -- '' ? ?,learned
545,cj68,) in effusive congratulation to Pip on his expectations .,learned
546,cj68,"We take leave of Pumblechook as he gloats over Pip's loss of fortune , extending his hand `` with a magnificently forgiving air '' and exhibiting `` the same fat five fingers '' , one of which he identifies with `` the finger of Providence '' and shakes at Pip in a canting imputation of the latter's `` ingratitoode '' and his own generosity as Pip's `` earliest benefactor '' .",learned
547,cj68,"Pip first learns `` the stupendous power of money '' from the sycophantic tailor , Mr. Trabb , whose brutality to his boy helper exactly matches the financial resource of each new customer , and whose fawning hands touch `` the outside of each elbow '' and `` rub '' Pip out of the shop .",learned
548,cj68,"The respectability which money confers implies a different etiquette , and , upon taking up the life of a London gentleman , Pip must learn from Herbert Pocket that `` the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under '' .",learned

558,cf30,The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment .,lore
559,cf30,No one here pokes fun at manly virtues .,lore
560,cf30,And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League .,lore
561,cf30,It even affects the faculty .,lore
562,cf30,"Thus , when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest , wildest , roaringest college weekend anywhere , any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup , Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb , topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl .",lore

619,cf30,Then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's great awakening began .,lore
620,cf30,He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college .,lore
621,cf30,"By 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1,107 .",lore

623,cf30,"The presidents of Cornell , Wisconsin , C.C.N.Y. , Bowdoin , Vermont , Brown , Columbia , Princeton , Yale , and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there .",lore
624,cf30,"Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today , with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates .",lore
625,cf30,"But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states , and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England .",lore
626,cf30,Over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class .,lore
627,cf30,"Only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students , and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation .",lore
628,cf30,About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools .,lore
629,cf30,It is still a college only and not a university ; ;,lore
630,cf30,"it is , in fact , the only college in the Ivy group .",lore
631,cf30,"However , three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the Dartmouth Medical School ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ) , the Thayer School of Engineering , and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration .",lore
632,cf30,"All three are purposely kept small , with a current total enrollment of about two hundred .",lore
633,cf30,"All three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and , like the college proper , place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study .",lore

644,cd02,"If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be `` understanded of the people '' -- and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation .",religion
645,cd02,This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching .,religion
646,cd02,The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention .,religion
647,cd02,"His point is not that mythology may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma .",religion
648,cd02,"When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence .",religion
649,cd02,"Mythological concepts may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols '' or `` ciphers '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms .",religion
650,cd02,"The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith '' .",religion
651,cd02,But this statement is completely unconvincing .,religion
652,cd02,"If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ) , the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant .",religion
653,cd02,Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated .,religion
654,cd02,"On the contrary , even in the heart of `` the Bible belt '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world .",religion
655,cd02,"In fact , it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed .",religion
656,cd02,"Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation , the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence .",religion
657,cd02,This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class .,religion
658,cd02,"Time and again in counseling and teaching , one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious .",religion
659,cd02,The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture-Protestantism '' so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches .,religion
660,cd02,"In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed , the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of `` folk religion '' current in the situation .",religion
661,cd02,This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's `` cult of reassurance '' or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel .,religion
662,cd02,But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected .,religion
663,cd02,"However , even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace .",religion
664,cd02,"To be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about `` the little flock '' and `` the great crowd '' and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the `` wisdom of the wise '' in the opening chapter of First Corinthians .",religion
665,cd02,But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation ? ?,religion
666,cd02,"Can the church risk assuming that the `` folly '' of men is as dear to God as their `` wisdom '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness of God '' and `` the foolishness of men '' are simply two ways of talking about the same thing ? ?",religion
667,cd02,Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious ? ?,religion
668,cd02,"There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives , however , from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world .",religion
669,cd02,"By analogy , the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world '' in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church .",religion
670,cd02,"But , as Scripture everywhere reminds us , God does have need of his creatures , and the church , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world , by God's providence , presents it .",religion
671,cd02,"And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men .",religion
672,cd02,"Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends .",religion
673,cd02,"In arguing in this way , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; ;",religion
674,cd02,and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction .,religion
675,cd02,"But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible , the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable .",religion
676,cd02,This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition .,religion
677,cd02,"If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right to say anything at all , then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian .",religion
678,cd02,"Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction , whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid .",religion
679,cd02,This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter .,religion
680,cd02,"Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us , has `` come of age '' ; ;",religion
681,cd02,"and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation , it is still a positive step forward ; ;",religion
682,cd02,and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .,religion
683,cd02,"In any event , it is an irreversible step , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us .",religion
684,cd02,"To say this , of course , is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years , or , at any rate , since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought .",religion
685,cd02,"We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher , Ritschl , Herrmann , Harnack , and Troeltsch , and more recently , Schweitzer and the early Barth and , in part at least , Bultmann .",religion
686,cd02,It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong .,religion
687,cd02,"For we must number here not only the names of Bushnell , Clarke , and Rauschenbusch , not to mention those of `` the Chicago School '' and Macintosh , but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ! !",religion
688,cd02,) Tillich as well .,religion
689,cd02,"Finally , we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead .",religion
690,cd02,What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world .,religion
691,cd02,"Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church , they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity .",religion
692,cd02,"They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture and , so far from considering this treason to God , have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him .",religion
693,cd02,"When we say , then , that today , in our situation , the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition , we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement .",religion
694,cd02,"However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations , the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism , not behind it .",religion
695,cd02,In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led .,religion
696,cd02,"For we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion , only one is really an alternative .",religion
697,cd02,"If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally , the position of the `` right '' is clearly untenable .",religion
698,cd02,"Whereas Bultmann's `` center '' position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone , the general position of the `` right '' , as represented , say , by Karl Barth , involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered .",religion
699,cd02,"It follows , then , provided the possibilities have been exhausted , that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the `` left '' , which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and , to some extent at least , is found in much that is significant in American and English theology .",religion
700,cd02,"In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible , we may develop this argument at greater length .",religion
701,cd02,"We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann , Barth , and Buri .",religion
702,cd02,"To do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two , then the question of a `` third '' possibility is a meaningless question .",religion
703,cd02,"Thus , if what is at issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case the judgment in question is false .",religion
704,cd02,"Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; ;",religion
705,cd02,"for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .",religion
706,cd02,"Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann .",religion
707,cd02,A second point requires more extended comment .,religion
708,cd02,"It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ;",religion
709,cd02,( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; ;,religion
710,cd02,"and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann's point of view , are mythological .",religion

861,cj57,"Some who have written on Utopia have treated it as `` a learned diversion of a learned world '' , `` a phantasy with which More amused himself '' , `` a holiday work , a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirits , a revel of debate , paradox , comedy and invention '' .",learned
862,cj57,"With respect to this view , two points are worth making .",learned
863,cj57,"First , it appears to be based on the fact that on its title page Utopia is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' .",learned
864,cj57,"It overlooks the other fact that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' .",learned
865,cj57,"It also overlooks the fact that in a rational lexicon , and quite clearly in More's lexicon , the opposite of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite of gay is not serious but solemn .",learned
866,cj57,More believed that a man could be both serious and gay .,learned
867,cj57,"That a writer who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion , sedulously fostered by all too many academics who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity which is the only mode of expression their authors are capable of .",learned
868,cj57,"Secondly , to find a learned diversion and a pleasing joke in More's account of the stupid brutalities of early sixteenth century wars , of the anguish of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful requires a callousness toward suffering and sin that would be surprising in a moral imbecile and most surprising in More himself .",learned
869,cj57,"Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon of Christ Church and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History , who fathered this most peculiar view , and in the brilliant Professor of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent .",learned
870,cj57,"But to return to the main line of our inquiry , it is doubtful that Utopia is still widely read because More was medieval or even because he was a martyr -- indeed , it is likely that these days many who read Utopia with interest do not even know that its author was a martyr .",learned
871,cj57,Utopia is still widely read because in a sense More stood on the margin of modernity .,learned
872,cj57,"And if he did stand on the margins of modernity , it was not in dying a martyr for such unity as Papal supremacy might be able to force on Western Christendom .",learned
873,cj57,"It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus's philological study of the New Testament .",learned
874,cj57,Similar literary exercises were the common doings of a Christian humanist of the first two decades of the sixteenth century .,learned
875,cj57,"Had More's writings been wholly limited to such exercises , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen or so other authors living in his time , whose works tenuously survive in the minds of the few hundred scholars who each decade in pursuit of their very specialized occasions read those works .",learned
876,cj57,More stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone -- because he wrote Utopia .,learned
877,cj57,"And the evidence that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual readers have responded to that book for the past century or so .",learned
878,cj57,"Only one other contemporary of More's evokes so immediate and direct a response , and only one other contemporary work -- Niccolo Machiavelli and The Prince .",learned
879,cj57,Can we discover what it is in Utopia that has evoked this response ? ?,learned
880,cj57,Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance there ; ;,learned
881,cj57,"we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval , the Renaissance , and the modern .",learned
882,cj57,"The medieval was the most important to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More , the author of Utopia , in some intelligible relation with St. Thomas More , the martyr .",learned
883,cj57,"To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance of Christian Humanism , the Renaissance elements are of primary concern .",learned
884,cj57,But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation ; ;,learned
885,cj57,we want to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has ; ;,learned
886,cj57,we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia .,learned
887,cj57,What is new about it ? ?,learned
888,cj57,To that question the answer is simple ; ;,learned
889,cj57,"it can be made in two words , Utopian communism .",learned
890,cj57,But it is an answer which opens the door wide to an onrush of objections and denials .,learned
891,cj57,Surely there is nothing new about communism .,learned
892,cj57,"We find it in Plato's Republic , and in Utopia More acknowledges his debt to that book .",learned
893,cj57,"We find it in that `` common way of life pleasing to Christ and still in use among the truest societies of Christians '' , that is , the better monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to Christianity .",learned
894,cj57,We find it in the later Stoic conception of man's natural condition which included the community of all possessions .,learned
895,cj57,This conception was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and theologians in the Middle Ages ; ;,learned
896,cj57,and More was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it .,learned
897,cj57,"But although the idea of communism is very old even in More's day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515 , it is not communism as such that we are concerned with .",learned
898,cj57,"We are concerned not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus : Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism ; ;",learned
899,cj57,"we are concerned with Utopian communism -- that is , simply communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia , as More conceived it .",learned
900,cj57,Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier types of communistic theory .,learned
901,cj57,We will achieve a more vivid sense of what it is by realizing what it is not .,learned
902,cj57,In Plato's Republic communism is -- to speak anachronistically -- a communism of Janissaries .,learned
903,cj57,"Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass , among whom private ownership prevails , the governing warrior elite .",learned
904,cj57,"Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods , wives , and children , was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of the individual human psyche ; ;",learned
905,cj57,and it is to this problem that the Republic ultimately returns .,learned
906,cj57,In More's Utopia communism is not a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass .,learned
907,cj57,Utopian communism applies to all Utopians .,learned
908,cj57,And in the economy of the book it is not peripheral but central .,learned
909,cj57,"The concern of Utopia is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering of a civil society ; ;",learned
910,cj57,and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering .,learned
911,cj57,"To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift of adjectives , misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's Republic : in the Republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athletes , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite of spiritual and religious athletes .",learned
912,cj57,The apostolic community was literally an elite : chosen by Christ himself .,learned
913,cj57,"And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic rigors , their spiritual athleticism .",learned
914,cj57,"Finally , the conception of the natural community of all possessions which originated with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time , although it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the Middle Ages .",learned
915,cj57,In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the Fall of Man .,learned
916,cj57,"It did not serve to contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order , because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man had sinned .",learned
917,cj57,The actual function of patristic communism was adequately set forth by St. Gregory almost a millenium before More wrote Utopia .,learned
918,cj57,`` The soil is common to all men .,learned
919,cj57,"When we give the necessities of life to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs .",learned
920,cj57,We should think of it more as an act of justice than compassion '' .,learned
921,cj57,Because community not severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what is his .,learned
922,cj57,"Indeed , of all that is his every man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated to regard himself as a custodian .",learned
923,cj57,"He is a trustee for the common good , however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping .",learned
924,cj57,"In contrast to this Stoic-patristic view , Utopia implies that the nature of man is such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve .",learned
925,cj57,The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions .,learned
926,cj57,In a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to a small voice so often still .,learned
927,cj57,In all the respects just indicated Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community of possessions and living plays a role .,learned
928,cj57,Neither from one of these conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced .,learned
929,cj57,We do not deny originality to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus found the tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks .,learned
930,cj57,"In a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may find in it , Utopian communism remains , as an integral whole , original -- a new thing .",learned
931,cj57,It is not merely a new thing ; ;,learned
932,cj57,it is one of the very few new things in Utopia ; ;,learned
933,cj57,most of the rest is medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism .,learned
934,cj57,But to say that at a moment in history something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; ;,learned
935,cj57,"and for this statement the best evidence comes within the five years following the publication of Utopia , when Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine's encounter with man .",learned
936,cj57,"New , indeed , is Luther's perception , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students what Luther was getting at .",learned
937,cj57,"Although Utopian communism is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism or even modern socialism , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice .",learned
938,cj57,Consider the features of Utopian communism : generous public provision for the infirm ; ;,learned
939,cj57,"democratic and secret elections of all officers including priests , meals taken publicly in common refectories ; ;",learned
940,cj57,a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens ; ;,learned
941,cj57,even houses changed once a decade ; ;,learned
942,cj57,"six hours of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars , and careful measures to prevent anyone from shirking ; ;",learned
943,cj57,"no private property , no money ; ;",learned
944,cj57,"no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services , and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term .",learned
945,cj57,"Whatever the merits of its intent , Utopian communism is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist or communist .",learned
946,cj57,"It is not the details of Utopian communism that make Utopia modern , it is the spirit , the attitude of mind that informs those details .",learned
947,cj57,"What that spirit and attitude were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history , the one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the Church Fathers of Late Antiquity .",learned

1092,cf06,`` To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power '' .,lore
1093,cf06,"We are creative , it seems , when we produce something which has not previously existed .",lore
1094,cf06,"Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake , building a chicken coop , or producing a book , to founding a business , creating a League of Nations or , developing a mature character .",lore
1095,cf06,"All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity , if it is only to reproduce a form like their own .",lore
1096,cf06,"While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process , he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability .",lore
1097,cf06,"An animal , bird or insect creates either a burrow , or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie .",lore
1098,cf06,Man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination .,lore
1099,cf06,"This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories , ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms .",lore
1100,cf06,It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world .,lore
1101,cf06,In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality .,lore
1102,cf06,The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941 .,lore
1103,cf06,In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more .,lore
1104,cf06,"It is in this one aspect , at least , that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator .",lore
1105,cf06,"Not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms , but even more importantly , he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself .",lore
1106,cf06,"We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes , acrobats , dancers , musicians and artists , developing many potentialities .",lore
1107,cf06,We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles .,lore
1108,cf06,"By this same combination of the will and the imagination , each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be .",lore
1109,cf06,"We must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that `` Man is the being that can continually remake himself , the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation '' .",lore
1110,cf06,So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created .,lore
1111,cf06,Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy .,lore
1112,cf06,Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process ? ?,lore
1113,cf06,"Sir Julian Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection , so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity .",lore
